# cocos2d-player
cocos2d-player JS is an Android player for running Javascript based CocosBuilder projects. 

It is a wireless sync tool that works in conjunction with CocosBuilder. 

Using cocos2d-player, you can publish your CocosBuilder JS project and run them wirelessly, directly from within CocosBuilder. 

The system uses bonjour/zeroconf protocol for network discovery and connection. No configuration/rebuilding required when changes are made to the CocosBuilder project.

## Minimum Requirements

## How to use

1. Start the cocos2d-player application.  
2. On CocosBuilder, Publish and run project
3. Set the pairing code. By default it is set as Auto on cocos2d-player - corresponding to empty pairing code on CocosBuilder. Only numbers are supported as pairing codes.
4. It will show connected, and should automatically run the CocosBuilder JS project after a short delay.
5. Next time you close and open the app. The *run* and *reset* buttons will be enabled, allowing you to run the last cached CocosBuilder project and clean the last cached CocosBuilder project respectively.
